(My best guess)" title=""><p>The human race... So big and broad! There are people all around the world with so many different ways of living. Customs, beliefs, fears and aspirations; we all have them. Fundamentally, we are all the same, but the different ways people live, the things
    they believe, what they strive for; these things can seem as foreign to an outsider as the sound of their unintelligible language.  Yet regardless of how or where we live and how we go about coming up with answers, we do all have the same basic questions.
    For example, “Who am I and why am I here?” We might not all word it the same, but we do all care about questions like these. We humans are actually quite obsessed with ourselves and very insecure. We are driven to look at other people and to compare
    ourselves with them.  We are in over our heads in this endeavor and many of us are not at all confident about how we fit and whether we belong.  You can see this playing out in the story line of almost any good novel or movie.  You can also see it
    in the way we value things like The News,  Soap operas, and Reality TV shows...  We try so hard to understand, or even just imagine what is the depth and the boundaries of our existence.  Our culture is directly tied to all this. It is basically our
    perspective about who we are. It gives us a sense of security about how life ought to be: what is proper and what is wrong, and more importantly, what is “normal”.  Our culture keeps us unified and like-minded. It promotes harmony, gives a sense of
    security, helps us laugh together and cry together. It helps us agree with each other and to stand unified against what does not seem right.  It’s not really that our culture controls us. We don’t have to OBEY it. There’s no list of dos and don’ts.
    We are actually A PART of our culture and we WANT to operate within it’s parameters.  Culture TEACHES US how to feel about things. This is so much more than simply trying to control us! We are our culture’s advocates. How we view ourselves  and how
    we view the rest of the world comes tied together with our culture.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-81835f65-864b-43eb-95ef-8d2a7f33816d" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="29"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="30"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9494eef248ba549694c16e59df8de546e6cfbc36.jpg" alt="Where does culture come from?" title=""><p>So where does culture itself come from then? If culture shapes my outlook, then what or who is deciding the things my culture should teach me? What is really shaping who I am?  I believe the answer is that “we” are shaping the culture that shapes us.
    It sounds kind of dumb when I say it like that. How can I shape something that is shaping me? Part of the answer is in the plurality. WE shape our culture which is shaping us. There is an unwitting give and take of many individuals; a consensus. It’s
    not a conscious thing that anyone does but rather, an evolution. I imagine it happens over a much longer time span than one person’s lifetime.  In the same way that we reflect our culture, our culture reflects us. Our instincts, our philosophies…
    Our culture is basically the unscripted version of what we believe it means to be human. It’s a collection of what rubs off of us over the years; our philosophical DNA…  I could probably go on with the metaphors,  this is kind of fun, but it’s all
    just conjecture. We can’t possibly know for certain how this all works, but we CAN see the effects of culture and the challenges involved when different cultures collide.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="31"><!-- react-empty: 32 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="33"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="35"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="36"><span data-reactid="37"><!-- react-empty: 38 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="39"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="40">Culture Matters</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="43"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
