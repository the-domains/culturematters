When I was a young boy, I lived with my parents deep in the Amazon jungle, in the remote Yanomamö village of Parima.  My life at that point seemed like one big adventure. We had exotic jungle pets, and it seemed like something exciting was always happening. 

Our house was the only place within 200 miles where the tribal people could get medical help, or trade for things like knives, soap, matches, and clothing. Our home was a sort of animal refuge, as well as the hospital, and the trading post. It seemed at times like we were the social services or even the red cross! My parents were often treating wounds from both sides of an argument that became physical, or wondering what to do with a woman who ran into our house like someone claiming asylum; wanting us to protect her from an angry husband!  There were very few dull moments and even the days when nothing was going on were restful and sweet. I'm sure my parents didn't quite see it the same as me; as all fun and excitement, but that's the perks of just being a kid. 

I didn't even mind that our home was like an ongoing reality tv show. When the Yanomamö didn't have anything better to do, which seemed to be often, they would come hang out at our house and watch us go about our lives. We had a room set up where they could come and go through their own door. The room had a half-wall separating it from the rest of our house. This was the the preferred vantage point to watch the show, but if these seats were all taken, newcomers would simply stand outside and watch us through a window. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/994da371069f187a17d28d001f40835abe2905a8.jpg)

I loved to fish and hunt with my Yanomamö friends, making small excursions out into the nearby grassy hills and even venturing into the jungle. I remember the excitement of exploring in a real jungle, and I remember how my friends always seemed so nonchalant and unimpressed about it all! If I wanted to try climbing the big mountain we could see from our house, my friends seemed more concerned about what kind of food I was going to bring along. If I wanted to check out the caves we saw, they didn't want to... If I wanted to stop and swim in a beautiful pool of water, they would say no way, it's dangerous.  They seemed to have been taught to "leave well enough alone", not to meddle or be curious, but rather to fear anything out of the ordinary.  And there were many things to fear;  the many spirits, for example, and the ghost-like people who lurked in the jungle and would strangle little kids with a piece of vine if they caught them alone.  I would sometimes make fun of their fear which in retrospect was not very smart. I didn't believe most of their scary stories, but they were the experts out in the jungle and not me!  Ironically though, when I was out in the jungle with my friends, they were actually depending on me for protection from the jungle monsters. I discovered this quite by accident one day when I got into an argument with one of my friends while we were out fishing. I forget what we had fought over, I just remember I ran off in the direction of home and my friend began to shriek and cry like a baby, begging me not to leave him alone! I don't know what he thought I could do to protect him but it was sobering to realize that he didn't want to be out in the jungle alone without me. Looking back, I think they mistook my skepticism about monsters and spirits for confidence that I could somehow overcome if a bad situation happened. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984c6751-c08d-4ff7-bfd9-83ce7d328d51.jpg)

As the years went by, my friends and I began to venture further into the jungle. I continued to learn a lot about the dangers, both imagined and real. My friends by now knew all to well about my fascination with anything mysterious or out of the ordinary.  To them, this was an odd obsession of mine that they simply took in stride. They did not relate in any way to the kind of things we foreigners found so interesting. They could see that we love to do things like stop and admire random flowers or leaves, so they began to bring us flowers and other interesting things that they found in their travels. Their enthusiasm was real enough, but as time went on it became clear that we weren't really on the same page even though they heartily participated in our enthusiasm.  I remember one time someone brought us a branch... just an ordinary branch from a small tree. He held it out with an expectant smile, telling the other Yanomamö, "They love this sort of thing."  If it weren't for events like this, we might never have known that they were simply playing along; keeping us happy; being good sports.    They must have thought we were very strange people! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ad9d7fbd-990a-45b7-bb9d-93ad0e26641c.jpg)

I'm sure that my own special friends understood me better than the rest of the Yanomamö, but even so I have no doubt that when I was not with them, they never for a moment considered doing the things they did with me. They see no reason for stopping at the top of a mountain to enjoy the view, or pausing at a beautiful waterfall. They most 

definitely would never considered tempting fate by climbing the rocks on the side of the water fall or swimming in the pool at the bottom, or jumping out of an overhanging tree into the water.  They were usually willing and even eager to do these things with me, but it was really my thing and not theirs. They still felt that it was "tempting fate", wanting to do and try things that human beings just don't do.  All things considered, they were very obliging. I think my friends secretly enjoyed pushing their boundaries with me. They could always use the excuse that they were simply humoring the foreigner kid.
