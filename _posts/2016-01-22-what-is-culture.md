The human race... So big and broad! There are people all around the world with so many different ways of living. Customs, beliefs, fears and aspirations; we all have them. Fundamentally, we are all the same, but the different ways people live, the things they believe, what they strive for; these things can seem as foreign to an outsider as the sound of their unintelligible language.  Yet regardless of how or where we live and how we go about coming up with answers, we do all have the same basic questions. For example, "Who am I and why am I here?" We might not all word it the same, but we do all care about questions like these. We humans are actually quite obsessed with ourselves and very insecure. We are driven to look at other people and to compare ourselves with them.  We are in over our heads in this endeavor and many of us are not at all confident about how we fit and whether we belong.  You can see this playing out in the story line of almost any good novel or movie.  You can also see it in the way we value things like The News,  Soap operas, and Reality TV shows...  We try so hard to understand, or even just imagine what is the depth and the boundaries of our existence.  Our culture is directly tied to all this. It is basically our perspective about who we are. It gives us a sense of security about how life ought to be: what is proper and what is wrong, and more importantly, what is "normal".  Our culture keeps us unified and like-minded. It promotes harmony, gives a sense of security, helps us laugh together and cry together. It helps us agree with each other and to stand unified against what does not seem right.  It's not really that our culture controls us. We don't have to OBEY it. There's no list of dos and don'ts.  We are actually A PART of our culture and we WANT to operate within it's parameters.  Culture TEACHES US how to feel about things. This is so much more than simply trying to control us! We are our culture's advocates. How we view ourselves  and how we view the rest of the world comes tied together with our culture.
