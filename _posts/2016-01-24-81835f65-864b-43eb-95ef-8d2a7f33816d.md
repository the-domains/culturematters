![Where does culture come from?](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9494eef248ba549694c16e59df8de546e6cfbc36.jpg)

So where does culture itself come from then? If culture shapes my outlook, then what or who is deciding the things my culture should teach me? What is really shaping who I am?  I believe the answer is that "we" are shaping the culture that shapes us. It sounds kind of dumb when I say it like that. How can I shape something that is shaping me? Part of the answer is in the plurality. WE shape our culture which is shaping us. There is an unwitting give and take of many individuals; a consensus. It's not a conscious thing that anyone does but rather, an evolution. I imagine it happens over a much longer time span than one person's lifetime.  In the same way that we reflect our culture, our culture reflects us. Our instincts, our philosophies... Our culture is basically the unscripted version of what we believe it means to be human. It's a collection of what rubs off of us over the years; our philosophical DNA...  I could probably go on with the metaphors,  this is kind of fun, but it's all just conjecture. We can't possibly know for certain how this all works, but we CAN see the effects of culture and the challenges involved when different cultures collide.
